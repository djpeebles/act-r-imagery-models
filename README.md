# act-r-imagery-models
Two ACT-R models of mental imagery phenomena: Image scanning and mental rotation.

These models work with ACT-R 7.12.10.  To run ACT-R from sources you will also need to have Quicklisp (https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/) installed for your Lisp application.

Installation.
1. Extract the actr7.x.zip file containing the ACT-R code.
2. In the resulting actr7.x folder, create a folder called 'models' and inside that folder create another folder called 'imagery-models'.
3. In the 'imagery-models' folder place the lisp file: sart.lisp

Running the models
